# Prompt log - main session

**Agent slug:** `main_session`
**Role:** Primary interactive agent. Architecture, decisions, implementation, and dispatch of subagents.

Significant prompts only, append-only, newest at the bottom. Rules: `/CLAUDE.md`.

> These entries were backfilled at 2026-09-10T18:20Z, in the same turn the logging rule was
> introduced. Timestamps are approximate to within a few minutes, anchored to `git log`.

### 2026-09-10T17:35Z - review_skills_and_plan_approach

**Prompt**

> can you check skills tailored to me as my best practices, after that read carefully the markdown
> file take-home-assessment, then tell me what you think what should be the approach in executing
> and developing the app in fullstack starting from this bare frameworks i have setted up.

**Outcome:** Settled the up-front decisions, Postgres with `Decimal(18,6)` prices, Socket.IO as the sole transport, and a shared zod contract package, then laid out a seven-phase plan for a roughly 12 hour budget. Also found nine defects in the committed scaffold, two of which break the Docker image rather than merely degrading it.

### 2026-09-10T17:41Z - remove_direct_ws_dependency

**Prompt:** "uninstall the ws since it will conflict with socket.io and that's what the instruction explicitly expected to happen that should never happen as far as i remember when it comes to simple prompting or no-engineer prompts."

**Outcome:** Removed `ws` from the backend manifest and lockfile after confirming no source file imported it. There was no runtime conflict to fix, since `socket.io` pulls `ws` in transitively through `engine.io`, so the direct entry had only left the transport choice ambiguous in the manifest.

### 2026-09-10T17:58Z - add_prompt_logging_rule

**Prompt**

> add a strict instruction for agent running in the scope of this project to follow through a
> markdown file for storing user prompts and 1 to 3 sentences narrowed response of the agent. each
> agent is a markdown file compiling the history of prompts and response. if the prompt or task is
> too complex or the response requires evidences or visualization that 1-3 sentences can discuss
> alone, a hyperlink to an artifact will be great showing what that prompt has really accomplished
> and achieved and that artifact should be made by the responding agent.

**Outcome:** Added the rule to a new root `CLAUDE.md`: significant prompts only, one append-only file per agent, a one to two sentence outcome, and an artifact whenever that is not enough. Artifacts are committed under `docs/artifacts/` rather than only published, because a published Artifact URL is private and the assessor receives nothing but this repository.

### 2026-09-10T18:45Z - align_plan_with_trade_model

**Prompt**

> is the blotter build plan properly aligned with the models in the markdown
> Trade Model
> At minimum, a trade should contain: interface Trade { id: string; symbol: string; quantity:
> number; price: number; side: "BUY" | "SELL"; trader: string; tradeDate: string; status: "ACTIVE"
> | "CANCELLED"; }
> [... truncated, ~1500 characters omitted: the sample payload and the suggested-fields list,
> pasted from `take-home-assessment.md`]

**Outcome:** The plan had no trade model in it at all, so its alignment with the brief was never established. Added a model section that resolves the brief's two internal contradictions, `id` against `tradeId` and `tradeDate` against `tradeTimestamp`, by carrying every field from both statements, and settled field naming, indexes and what makes the seeded data realistic.

### 2026-09-10T18:10Z - fix_remaining_scaffold_gaps

**Prompt**

> what are the remaining gaps besides the two that you have given a red banner BREAKS BUILD/RUN and
> other gaps listed ? if there's nothing else, proceed fixing it and after finishing, merge it to
> the default branch.

**Outcome:** Found thirteen further gaps beyond the nine already listed, among them a missing root README, a healthcheck that never touched the database, and Prisma 7 requiring a driver adapter, a generator output path and a `prisma.config.ts` that the scaffold had never installed. Closed all twenty-two by restructuring the repository into npm workspaces with a shared zod contract, adding the Postgres schema, hand-authored migration and realistic seed, hardening the API, and rebuilding both Dockerfiles, then verified it by running the stack rather than asserting it.

### 2026-09-12T01:57Z - research_mvp_requirements_and_gaps

**Prompt**

> i want you to perform a deep research for what is needed for this application accordingly for what
> the user should see. @D:\My Folder\tp-icap-take-home-assessment\take-home-assessment.md goal is to
> have a list of both ui/ux and server requirements to achieve a viable true MVP of this system.
> you perform deep research through various sources that provides necessary data for a financial
> application/system or a small to large trading application/system that manages a trade blotter
> containing equity trades. and another goal is to close the gap on what's already planned by 2
> agents running on the same repositories on their own worktree both for the frontend and backend
> works.

**Outcome:** Four parallel research passes produced a sourced must/should/won't requirement list for the server and the interface, each line then checked against the code on the three unmerged branches rather than against the handoff notes. Found seventeen of twenty-three server musts already built, thirteen ranked gaps, five places where the backend and design plans disagree, and two verified data defects: a Saturday trade date in the seed and London names priced in pounds where the market quotes pence.
